# Introduction
This repository contains the code that was developed during my master thesis at the KU Leuven on 'Particle, Fluid and Hybrid Numerical Methods for Radiation Therapy'.  

# Dependencies
A full state of all the pip packages that I had installed in the virtual environment is given in the requirements.txt file (contains a lot of unused packages).

## Dependencies for running the code
    - Scipy
    - Numpy
    - mpi4py
    - Numba

## Dependencies for running the jupyter notebooks
    - pingouin (for some Q-Q plots)
    - pillow (for working with lung image)
    - py-pde (for solving advection-diffusion equation)
    - SymPy
